                <h2>Implementation Comparison</h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the "Discover Hungary" webpage using custom CSS (Part A) and Bootstrap (Part B)
                    presented a few challenges and benefits. With custom CSS, I had to spend more time setting up the
                    layout and styling everything from scratch. It was a bit tricky but gave me a lot of control over
                    how things looked. On the other hand, using Bootstrap was much quicker. It has ready-made components
                    that made building a responsive design easy</p>
                <p>
                    I found the Bootstrap version to be easier and faster to work with. The documentation for Bootstrap
                    was really helpful, which made fixing issues simpler. With Bootstrap (Part B), things were much
                    quicker. I used Bootstrap's grid system with classes like <code>row</code> and <code>col</code> to
                    create responsive layouts easily. The card component was super helpful for displaying attractions -
                    I just had to use <code>card</code>, <code>card-body</code>, and <code>card-title</code> classes to
                    get a nice, consistent look. I also used Bootstrap's utility classes like <code>text-center</code>
                    and <code>mb-4</code> for quick styling and spacing. While it was faster and easier with Bootstrap,
                    I felt like I had less control over the fine details of the design compared to the custom CSS
                    version.
